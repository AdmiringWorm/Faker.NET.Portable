Title: How can I get my question added to the FAQ?
---

## Answer
You have two choices to do this, depending on wether you know the answer to your question or not.
1. In the case where you don't know the answer of your question, you can just either ask your question
   on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/Faker-NET-Portable/Lobby), or open a question on our
   [github repository](https://github.com/WormieCorp/Faker.NET.Portable/issues).
   **NOTE: The question is not guaranteed to be added to the FAQ, but most likely will**
2. Open a PR to our [github repository](https://github.com/WormieCorp/Faker.NET.Portable) and add
   the necessary markdown page in the [faq documentation path](https://github.com/WormieCorp/Faker.NET.Portable/tree/develop/docs/faq).
   As soon as your PR is accepted, your question and answer will be available in our Documentation.
