<p>
	This user guide, like Faker.NET.Portable itself, is under active development. Some parts of it aren't
	documented as completely as they need to be, but we gladly accept your contributions.
</p>

<p>
	We need your help to improve the documentation for Faker.NET.Portable, so if there is something that you
	would like to add then you can edit the content directly on GitHub.
